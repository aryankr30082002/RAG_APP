# RAG_APP
RAG-based Question Answering System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that enhances a Large Language Model (LLM) with external knowledge for accurate, grounded, and context-aware responses. It is designed to handle both structured digital PDFs and scanned PDFs (via OCR).

🚀 Features
📂 Document Ingestion & Processing

Extracts text from structured PDFs (digital).

Handles scanned/unstructured PDFs using OCR (Tesseract / Unstructured loaders).

Supports multiple file formats for ingestion.

🗂️ Vector Store Integration

Store embeddings using Chroma or FAISS for efficient similarity search.

🤖 Retriever + Generator Architecture

Retrieve relevant context and generate accurate answers using LLMs.

🧠 Conversational Memory

Maintains multi-turn conversation history for context retention.

💻 Streamlit Interface

Intuitive web app for interactive document Q&A.

🔄 Workflow

Upload Document(s) → Extract text (direct parsing or OCR for scanned PDFs).

Embed & Store → Create embeddings and index in vector database.

Query → User enters a question.

Retrieve + Generate → System fetches context and generates grounded answer.

Response → Display accurate, context-aware results.

🛠️ Tech Stack

LangChain – RAG pipeline orchestration

Chroma / FAISS – Vector database for retrieval

OCR Tools – Tesseract, UnstructuredPDFLoader, PyPDF2, PDFPlumber

Embeddings – OpenAI / HuggingFace / Cohere

Deployment & UI – Streamlit / FastAPI

🎯 Use Cases

📚 Research Assistant – Summarize and query research papers.

🏢 Enterprise Knowledge Base – Efficient Q&A over company documents.

📖 Legal & Financial Analysis – Search and interpret contracts/reports.

📊 Business Reports – Extract insights from scanned/unstructured docs.

▶️ Getting Started
🔧 Installation
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-qa-system.git
cd rag-qa-system

# Create environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

⚡ Run the App
streamlit run app.py

📌 Roadmap

 Add support for multi-document querying

 Integrate with advanced LLMs (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral)

 Improve OCR accuracy for low-quality scans

 Deploy as a FastAPI backend with React/Next.js frontend
